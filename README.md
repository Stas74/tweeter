# Tweeter Project

It is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.
Uses inside HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. Created to practice front-end skill.

## Features

You can send by Tweeter a message (length is limited to 140 characters, of course, you always can see a counter, welcome back deja vu) instead of real users and display them on the same page without a redirect. Users have a random name, avatars, and username. 

Almost have the same option as having "Big Brother", but this app is for you only.
